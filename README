# Wasm Interpreter

This is a course project for CMU 17770, Virtual Machines and Managed Runtimes.
This codebase contains code for a Wasm Interpreter in pure Rust, the internal
data type only suppoers i32, f64 and opaque types(Refs). It also only supports
limited number of instructions, but mainly major ones.

Moreover, Passive elements are not supported and custom section is not implemented.

## TODO
1. More comprehensive tests
2. Covers more types
